description: "The Magic Pudding: Being The Adventures of Bunyip Bluegum and his friends\
  \ Bill Barnacle and Sam Sawnoffâ€‡is an Australian children's book written and illustrated\
  \ by Norman Lindsay. It is a comic fantasy, and a classic of Australian children's\
  \ literature.\nThe story is set in Australia with humans mixing with anthropomorphic\
  \ animals. It tells of a magic pudding which, no matter how often it is eaten, always\
  \ reforms in order to be eaten again. It is owned by three companions who must defend\
  \ it against Pudding Thieves who want it for themselves.\nThe book is divided into\
  \ four \"slices\" instead of chapters. There are many short songs interspersed throughout\
  \ the text, varying from stories told in rhyme to descriptions of a character's\
  \ mood or behaviour, and verses of an ongoing sea song.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
